# Project Title

Recreated the Popular A* pathfinding algorithm and abstracted into classes for re-usability, The main goal of this project was to get familliar with my fundamentals like const-correctness and referencing to really try and create a good representation of my skills. 

## Upgrades to consider/implement

Currently the A* pathfinder works with any user created size however there is no GUI and the output is very bland. Would really like to learn OpenGL and create some kind of beautiful representation for the traversals.

GLFW instead of SDL2 currently found GLFW much easier and cleaner to use for keyboard strokes than SDL2, much more straightforward. 

Still have to fix a bunch of bugs especially when blockages are created, Very hard to identify the bug as I can't recreate it often.

Added the inital source files to produce a screen using OPENGL, this feels like a good point to get to. Need to read up on transformation matricies to produce a grid the user specifies but I won't really be able to progress until then.


### Things Left I want to do:

Modify opengl to replicate A* console

Make a GUI 

Reduce amount of bugs when traversing through blocks

Optimise and clean code

Learn how to use Cmake well
